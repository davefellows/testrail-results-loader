# testrail-results-loader
Parses Test Results report files and loads them into TestRail as Test Run results. Idea is to leverage TestRail's rich test reporting UX.

Not finalized. Abandoned due to TestRail limitations e.g max length on test names not accomodating xUnits verbose naming scheme. Also had reservations on TestRail's ability to handle 10s of thousands of unit tests.

More unit testing required and general polish.
